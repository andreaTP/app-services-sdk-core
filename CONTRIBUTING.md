## Documentation portal

Documentation portal is available https://console.redhat.com/docs/api

> NOTE: Documentation portal uses `doc-portal` branch as source for the API
When releasing service to production we need to trigger documentation portal release

### Releasing documentation portal changes

Create release with `docs/` prefix. For example `docs/v0.1.0`.
Review openapi updates.
