## Documentation portal

Documentation portal is available https://console.redhat.com/docs/api

> NOTE: Documentation portal uses `doc-portal` branch as source for the API
When releasing service to production we need to trigger documentation portal release

### Releasing documentation portal changes

Create release with `docs/` prefix. For example `docs/v0.1.0`.
Review openapi updates.

## Autogeneration of SDKs

1. All SDKs are autogenerated using OpenAPI Generator project.
2. Bot accounts creates PR with the new versions of the SDK that needs be reviewed by the team
3. Once PR is merged developers are responsible for creating tagged release

## Generating API clients locally

```bash
make generate
```

## Checking standards

```bash
spectral lint ./.openapi/kafka-admin-rest.yaml 
```
